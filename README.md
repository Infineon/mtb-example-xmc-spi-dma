# XMC&trade; MCU: SPI DMA

This code example demonstrates how to use the DMA driver to transfer data from the RAM to the SPI buffer freeing the CPU for other tasks.

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.0
- [SEGGER J-Link software](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack)
- Programming Language: C
- Associated Parts: All [XMC™ MCU](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-industrial-microcontroller-based-on-arm-cortex-m/) parts

## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm® Embedded Compiler v10.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; compiler v6.16 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ compiler v9.30.1 (`IAR`)

## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [XMC4700 Relax Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_xmc47_relax_v1/) (`KIT_XMC47_RELAX_V1`) - Default value of `TARGET`

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

An external jumper wire is required to connect between MOSI (P0_5) and MISO (P0_4) pins.

## Software setup

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details open><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created.

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details open><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox&trade; applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps:

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details open><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

**Note:** Only VS Code is supported.

1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

</details>


## Operation

1. Externally connect the jumper wire between MOSI() and MISO() pins.

2. Connect the board to your PC using a micro-USB cable through the debug USB connector.

3. Program the board using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;:

   1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (JLink)**.

    After programming, the application starts automatically.

4. Observe LED1 blinking, which indicates successful data transfer using SPI.

5. To illustrate a transfer error, remove the external connection made in Step 1 and observe LED2 glow.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (JLink)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


## Design and implementation

In this example project, SPI is configured so that a data buffer (src) is transferred through the SPI MOSI pin to the MISO pin of the same SPI component. After the transfer, the received data is compared with the transmitted data. If the transfer is successful, the data received is the same as the data transmitted. The LEDs indicate the success or failure of the data transfer.

DMA helps in offloading the data transfer from the CPU, allowing it to perform other tasks. The role of DMA in this code example is to place the firmware data buffer (src) on the SPI output FIFO and also to read the data buffer (dst) from the SPI input FIFO after the transfer.
