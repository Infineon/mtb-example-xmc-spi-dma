## Software setup

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example clones the "[SPI DMA](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-xmc-spi-dma)" application with the desired name "SPIDMA" configured for the *KIT_XMC47_RELAX_V1* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC47_RELAX_V1 --app-id mtb-example-xmc-spi-dma --user-app-name SPIDMA --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the KIT_XMC48_RELAX_ECAT_V1 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/SPIDMA" --add-bsp-name KIT_XMC48_RELAX_ECAT_V1 --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/SPIDMA" --set-active-bsp APP_KIT_XMC48_RELAX_ECAT_V1
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br />

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

## Operation
1. Externally connect the jumper wire between MOSI and MISO pins.

2. Connect the board to your PC using a micro-USB cable through the debug USB connector.

3. Program the board using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software:

   1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (JLink)**.

    After programming, the application starts automatically.

4. Observe LED1 blinking, which indicates successful data transfer using SPI.

5. To illustrate a transfer error, remove the external connection made in **Step 1** and observe LED2 glow.

**Note:** Only KIT_XMC_PLT2GO_XMC4200 doesn't have two LEDs, so the illustration of a transfer error will be the same as in **Step 5**, with LED1 constantly glowing.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (JLink)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


## Design and implementation

In this example project, SPI is configured so that a data buffer (src) is transferred through the SPI MOSI pin to the MISO pin of the same SPI component. After the transfer, the received data is compared with the transmitted data. If the transfer is successful, the data received is the same as the data transmitted. The LEDs indicate the success or failure of the data transfer.

DMA helps in offloading the data transfer from the CPU, allowing it to perform other tasks. The role of DMA in this code example is to place the firmware data buffer (src) on the SPI output FIFO and also to read the data buffer (dst) from the SPI input FIFO after the transfer.
